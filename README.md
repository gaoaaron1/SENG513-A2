# Interactions
Ensure that there are at least 2-3 significant interactive mechanisms in your implementation. This could be player-to-player interactions, 
player-to-environment, or any other meaningful gameplay interaction.

-I am doing a player-to-player interaction as well as a player-to-environment interaction.


# Depth over Breadth
It's more important to have a few well-implemented, polished features than many shallow ones. Focus on depth in 
the mechanics you choose to include.

-I will focus on sprite frames.


# Clear Milestone
Set clear milestones for your game. What will be the "win" conditions? Is it a certain number of rounds, points, or 
achieving a specific goal? Define these clearly so that gameplay has a purpose and endpoint.
Remember, the aim of this assignment is to demonstrate your understanding of game design, your ability to code 
specific functionalities, and your creativity. It's not to produce a complete, commercial-grade game. Keep the 
scope manageable and focus on quality.

-Win condition is to defeat your opponent.
